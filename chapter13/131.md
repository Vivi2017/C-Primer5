A copy constructor is a constructor whose first parameter is a reference to the class type and any additional parameters have default values.

The copy constructor may be used when we use copy initialization, but not always.



A copy constructor is a constructor which first parameter is a reference to the class type and any additional parameters have default values.

When copy initialization happens and that copy initialization requires either the copy constructor or the move constructor.

1. Define variables using an =

2. Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of non-reference type

3. Return an object from a function that has a non-reference return type

4. Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class

5. Some class types also use copy initialization for the objects they allocate.


class Foo{
public:
    Foo();
    Foo(const Foo &copyFoo);
};
